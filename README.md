Project: Simple Registration Form

Overview:
In this project, I developed a basic registration form that includes fields like name, email, password, and a submit button. It uses HTML to structure the form, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for handling events, specifically the addEventListener method to capture user interactions.

Key Features:
- Form fields with validation (basic checks for required fields)
- Styled form using CSS for a clean and responsive design
- JavaScript used to capture form submission and handle events like input focus

Technologies Used:
- HTML: To structure the form elements and layout
- CSS: For styling the form, ensuring responsiveness across devices
- JavaScript: To handle form submission, validation, and interaction with the user

Learning Outcomes:
- Gained a deeper understanding of how forms are created and styled
- Learned how to use addEventListener in JavaScript to manage user input and form events
- Explored basic form validation techniques

How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.

2. Open the index.html file in a browser to see the form in action.
